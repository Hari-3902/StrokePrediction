# StrokePrediction
R Programming to compare and evaluate machine learning models.

The dataset contains 5110 records and 12 features.
The target variable in this dataset is highly imbalanced. To address this, I have applied upsampling techniques.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the data patterns and helps in feature selection.
Applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest to predict stroke.

Logistic Regression gave 77 percent accuracy whereas Random Forest gave 93% accuracy
